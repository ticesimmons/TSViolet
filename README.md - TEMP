# TSViolet - TEMP

the main branch for temporary changes / testing

current TODO:
     figure out excel and dove topography
     refine utils(i.e. figure out mouse movements)
     integrate changes into the feelers
     put referenced jars on github page?(idk if it's neccessary we'll see)
     switch to VSCode?(eclipse currently is being manually compared to the repo and I'm not sure how to use it with git)
